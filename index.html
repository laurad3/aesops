			<h2>The Greedy Dog</h2>

			<p>A dog was crossing the river with a piece of meat in his mouth. He saw his reflection in the water and thought it was another dog carrying what looked like a bigger piece of meat than his own. Straight away the dog dropped his meat and made a grab for the larger piece. Of course, he ended up with nothing, for his own piece was swept away by the river and the other was just a reflection.</p>

			<p class="moral">"Greedy people end up with less."</p>

			<h2>The Crow and the Raven</h2>

			<p>A Crow became very jealous of a Raven, because the latter was regarded by men as a bird of omen which foretold the future, and was accordingly held in great respect by them. She was very anxious to get the same sort of reputation herself; and, one day, seeing some travellers approaching, she flew on to a branch of a tree at the roadside and cawed as loud as she could. The travellers were in some dismay at the sound, for they feared it might be a bad omen; till one of them, spying the Crow, said to his companions, It’s all right, my friends, we can go on without fear, for it’s only a crow and that means nothing."</p>

			<p class="moral">"Those who pretend to be something they are not only make themselves ridiculous."</p>

			<h2>The Fox and the Grapes</h2>

			<p>A hungry fox saw some delicious-looking bunches of grapes hanging from a vine which had climbed along the branch of a tree. He jumped as high as he could, but was unable to reach them. In the end he gave up and walked off saying, "I thought they were ripe, but in fact I see they are sour."</p>

			<p class="moral">"Those who can't have something will often try to save face by saying it's not worth having."</p>

				<h2>The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing</h2>

				<p>A hungry wolf decided to use a disguise in order to get among a flock of sheep without being noticed. He covered himself in a sheepskin and slipped in among the flock while they were out grazing. The shepherd didn't notice, and in the evening he penned the wolf in with the other sheep. So far all had gone to plan, but it happened that meat was needed for the table that night. Taking his knife, the shepherd went over to the pen and killed what he thought was one of his sheep. It turned out to be the wolf.</p>

				<p class="moral">"It is dangerous to pretend to be something you are not."</p>

				<h2>The Boy Who Cried Wolf!</h2>

				<p>A young shepherd grew bored while watching his flock near a village. He amused himself by pretending that a wolf was attacking his sheep, and shouted very loudly "Wolf! wolf!" The villagers would come running to help, only to find the shepherd boy laughing at them. The Wolf, however, did truly come at last. The shepherd-boy, now really alarmed, shouted in an agony of terror: "Pray, do come and help me; the Wolf is killing the sheep"; but no one paid any heed to his cries, nor rendered any assistance. The Wolf, having no cause of fear, at his leisure lacerated or destroyed the whole flock. </p>

				<p class="moral">"There is no believing a liar, even when he speaks the truth."</p>
